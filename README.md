# Password-Manager-App
This is a password manager app built using python. The user can enter the Website name, email address and the password. The program will then store the password in a .txt file. 
User can also generate a very strong password by pressing the button provided in the app. The password generated by the app has numbers(0-9), letters(a-z,A-Z) and all the symbols.
Hence the password generated by the app will be much stronger.
